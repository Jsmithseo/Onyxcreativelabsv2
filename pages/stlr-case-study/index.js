                  Our client needed to transition from a traditional WordPress
                  site to a more modern, scalable solution. We opted to convert
                  their WordPress site into a headless CMS using Next.js, vastly
                  improving the speed and performance of the site. Beyond just a
                  website, we developed a full web app that automates various
                  business operations like communication, artist availability,
                  contracts, and payments.

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Performance Issues:</strong> The original
                      WordPress site was slow and couldn't handle scaling
                      effectively.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Manual Operations:</strong> Processes like
                      communication, contract management, and payment handling
                      were all manual.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Budget Constraints:</strong> The client had a
                      budget of $15k with an ongoing $1k monthly maintenance
                      fee.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Headless CMS:</strong> We converted the WordPress
                      site to a headless CMS with a Next.js frontend, improving
                      speed and user experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Web App Development:</strong> We developed a web
                      app to automate communication, artist availability,
                      contracts, and payments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> By avoiding a native
                      app, we kept development costs low and ensured easy
                      maintenance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Student Involvement:</strong> Our team of students
                      worked in two-week sprints, gaining valuable experience
                      and contributing to the project's success.
